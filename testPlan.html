            <p>
                The following is an automated test suite for the <a href="https://practice.sdetunicorns.com/" target="_blank">practice SDET-Unicorns website</a>.
                Written in JavaScript with WebdriverIO, it serves as a smoke test for the different pages that are available on the top menu bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Home.js is a test to assert that the homepage has the correct title of "Practice E-Commerce Site â€“ SDET Unicorns."
            </p>
            <p>
                About.js tests the about page by ensuring that it has the intended URL of the about page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Contact.js verifies the contact form functionality by opening the contact page, filling in the contact form provided with
                randomized data, and submitting the info by clicking the submit button. Following this, it asserts whether a proper success alert is sent or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blog.js opens the blog page and checks if each item in the recent posts list has a length of at least 10 characters. Then, it tests
                for the amount of items that are listed and passes if there is the intended amount of five items.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gettingStarted.js test case clicks the "Get Started" button on the homepage, and asserts that the URL includes "get-started"
                in it afterwards. It then clicks on the logo of the website, and checks to see if the URL does not contain "get-started" anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                To assist with the programming of these automated tests, the page-object model is used for the home-page, contact-page, and
                blog-page. These allow for better code readability within the test scripts and ease of use in the testing framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                To run the test suite, open the terminal and type "npx wdio --suite smoke". To run all tests, type "npx wdio". In addition,
                there is a test suite to test all the scripts intended for the different pages, which can be run with "npx wdio --suite pages".
